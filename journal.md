# Development Journal - Drainfield Placer

## 2025-10-05 - Specification Format Update & Tank Drawing Feature

**Time:** 18:45 UTC
**Status:** ✓ IMPLEMENTED
**Priority:** HIGH

---

### Summary

Completed major enhancements to septic system specifications and CAD output:

1. **Reversed specification text order** to match desired format (bottom-to-top display)
2. **Replaced placeholder "X" values** with actual dimensions from data and calculations
3. **Added dosing tank specifications** with proper sizing logic
4. **Implemented tank drawing feature** - septic and dosing tanks now drawn as rectangles in CAD output

---

### Problem Report

User requested three critical improvements to the specification output:

**Issue 1: Specification Text Order**
- Current format displayed top-to-bottom (title first, cores last)
- Desired format: bottom-to-top (cores first, title last)
- Required to match standard drawing conventions

**Issue 2: Placeholder Values**
- Specification text showed "X SF DRAINFIELD" instead of actual drainfield size
- Showed "X SF UNOBSTRUCTED AREA" instead of actual boundary area
- Showed "X GALLON SEPTIC TANK" instead of actual available tank size

**Issue 3: Missing Dosing Tank**
- Specifications only included septic tank
- Needed to add dosing tank with proper sizing (300 or 500 gallon residential)
- For requirements > 500 gallons, use single compartment septic tank instead

**Issue 4: No Visual Tank Representation**
- Tanks were specified in text but not drawn in CAD output
- Needed visual rectangles with proper dimensions (converted from inches to feet)
- Should be placed near specification text at (0,0)

---

### Implementation Details

#### Part 1: Specification Format & Order (specifications.py)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Reversed line order** - Specifications now build from bottom to top:
   ```
   Old Order (top-to-bottom):        New Order (bottom-to-top):
   =============================     CORE #2: 0.10 feet ABOVE B.M.
   SEPTIC SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS      CORE #1: 0.10 feet ABOVE B.M.
   =============================     1038 SF OF UNOBSTRUCTED...
   BENCHMARK: this is the bm         DRAINFIELD CONFIGURATION: Bed
   PROPOSED X GALLON SEPTIC TANK     PROPOSED 792 SF DRAINFIELD...
   PROPOSED X SF DRAINFIELD...       PROPOSED 500 GALLON DOSING...
   DRAINFIELD CONFIGURATION: Bed     PROPOSED 1250 GALLON SEPTIC...
   X SF OF UNOBSTRUCTED...           BENCHMARK: this is the bm
   CORE #1: 0.10 feet ABOVE B.M.     ==============================
   CORE #2: 0.10 feet ABOVE B.M.     SEPTIC SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
                                     ==============================
   ```

2. **Added actual value parameters:**
   - `drainfield_size_actual`: Actual drainfield credit (from selection result metadata)
   - `boundary_area_actual`: Actual boundary area from polyline_boundary

3. **Added septic tank size lookup:**
   - Loads available tank sizes from `data/fdep_tanks.csv`
   - Available sizes: [278, 483, 750, 900, 1050, 1090, 1111, 1250, 1278, 1500, 1537]
   - `get_actual_tank_size()` finds next available size ≥ required
   - Example: Required 1200 → Actual 1250

**Code Example:**
```python
# Get actual values
actual_drainfield = drainfield_size_actual if drainfield_size_actual is not None else drainfield_size_required
actual_boundary = int(boundary_area_actual) if boundary_area_actual is not None else unobstructed_area_required
actual_tank_size = self.get_actual_tank_size(tank_size_required)

# Build lines in REVERSE ORDER
lines.append(f"CORE #2: {core_depth:.2f} feet {core_above_below} B.M.")
lines.append(f"CORE #1: {core_depth:.2f} feet {core_above_below} B.M.")
lines.append(f"{actual_boundary} SF OF UNOBSTRUCTED AREA REQUIRED, {unobstructed_area_required} SF REQUIRED.")
# ... more lines in reverse order
lines.append("=" * 30)
lines.append("SEPTIC SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS")
lines.append("=" * 30)
```

#### Part 2: Dosing Tank Specifications (specifications.py)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added dosing tank size loader:**
   - Limited to 300 and 500 gallon tanks only (per contractor preference)
   - `_load_available_dosing_tank_sizes()` returns `[300, 500]`

2. **Dosing tank sizing logic:**
   - Requirement ≤ 300 gal → 300 gallon dosing tank
   - Requirement 301-500 gal → 500 gallon dosing tank
   - Requirement > 500 gal → Use septic tank sizes (750, 900, 1050, etc.)

3. **Added to specification output:**
   ```
   PROPOSED 500 GALLON DOSING TANK, 375 GALLON REQUIRED.
   PROPOSED 1250 GALLON SEPTIC TANK, 1200 GALLON REQUIRED.
   ```

**Available Tank Sizes Confirmed:**
- 300 gallon: Tank 70-109-03S-C3 (48.5" × 48.5")
- 500 gallon: Tank 70-109-05S-C4 (60.0" × 60.0")

**Code Example:**
```python
def get_actual_dosing_tank_size(self, required_gallons):
    # Try dosing tank sizes first (300 or 500)
    for size in self.available_dosing_tank_sizes:
        if size >= required_gallons:
            return size

    # If requirement > 500, use single compartment septic tank instead
    for size in self.available_tank_sizes:
        if size >= required_gallons:
            return size

    return required_gallons
```

#### Part 3: Tank Drawing Feature (placer.py)

**New Functions Added:**

1. **`get_tank_dimensions(tank_gallons, data_dir="data")`**
   - Loads tank dimensions from `data/fdep_tanks.csv`
   - Converts inches to feet (divides by 12.0)
   - Returns `(width_ft, length_ft)` tuple
   - Example: 1250 gal → (5.50 ft, 10.79 ft) from (66" × 129.5")

2. **`create_tank_rectangle(x, y, width_ft, length_ft, label)`**
   - Creates closed polyline representing tank
   - 5 points (rectangle with closing point)
   - Adds metadata: source, type, label, dimensions
   - Assigned to "tanks" layer

**Integration with place_drainfield():**

Updated function signature:
```python
def place_drainfield(base_cad_json, selection_result, spec_text=None,
                    septic_tank_gallons=None, dosing_tank_gallons=None):
```

**Tank Placement Layout:**
- **Starting position**: x=20.0 ft (right of spec text), y=0.0 (aligned with top)
- **Spacing**: 2.0 ft between tanks
- **Order**: Septic tank first, then dosing tank

**Tank Drawing Logic:**
```python
tank_x_start = 20.0
tank_y_start = 0.0
tank_spacing = 2.0
current_x = tank_x_start

# Add septic tank
if septic_tank_gallons:
    dims = get_tank_dimensions(septic_tank_gallons)
    if dims:
        width_ft, length_ft = dims
        tank_poly = create_tank_rectangle(current_x, tank_y_start, width_ft, length_ft,
                                         f'SEPTIC TANK {septic_tank_gallons} GAL')
        output_cad['polylines'].append(tank_poly)

        # Add label at center
        label_text = {
            'x': current_x + length_ft / 2,
            'y': tank_y_start + width_ft / 2,
            'text': f'SEPTIC TANK\n{septic_tank_gallons} GAL',
            'height': 3
        }
        output_cad['texts'].append(label_text)

        current_x += length_ft + tank_spacing

# Add dosing tank (similar logic)
```

#### Part 4: Main Workflow Updates (main.py)

**Changes in Step 2 (Tank Requirements):**
```python
septic_tank_size = self.tank_sizer.get_septic_tank_size(flow_gpd, num_homes)
dosing_tank_size = self.tank_sizer.get_pump_tank_size(flow_gpd, is_residential=True)
print(f"  Septic Tank Required: {septic_tank_size} gallons")
print(f"  Dosing Tank Required: {dosing_tank_size} gallons")
```

**Changes in Step 4 (Generate Specifications):**
```python
# Get actual drainfield credit from result
if is_split:
    df1_metadata = result['drainfield_1']['metadata']
    drainfield_size_actual = df1_metadata.get('credit_sqft', drainfield_size_required)
else:
    metadata = result.get('metadata', {})
    drainfield_size_actual = metadata.get('credit_sqft', drainfield_size_required)

spec_text = self.spec_generator.generate_specification(
    # ... existing parameters
    dosing_tank_required=dosing_tank_size if not has_atu else None,
    drainfield_size_actual=drainfield_size_actual,
    boundary_area_actual=boundary_area
)
```

**Changes in Step 6 (Generate Output JSON):**
```python
# Get actual tank sizes (from spec generator logic)
actual_septic_tank = None
actual_dosing_tank = None

if not has_atu:
    actual_septic_tank = self.spec_generator.get_actual_tank_size(septic_tank_size)
    actual_dosing_tank = self.spec_generator.get_actual_dosing_tank_size(dosing_tank_size)

# Place drainfield with tanks
if is_split:
    output_json = place_split_drainfield(boundary_json, result, spec_text,
                                        actual_septic_tank, actual_dosing_tank)
else:
    output_json = place_drainfield(boundary_json, result, spec_text,
                                  actual_septic_tank, actual_dosing_tank)
```

---

### Technical Impact

**Before Changes:**
- Specification text order: Top-to-bottom (title first)
- Values: All placeholders ("X SF DRAINFIELD", "X GALLON SEPTIC TANK")
- Dosing tank: Not included in specifications
- Tank visualization: None

**After Changes:**
- Specification text order: Bottom-to-top (cores first, title last)
- Values: All actual ("792 SF DRAINFIELD", "1250 GALLON SEPTIC TANK")
- Dosing tank: Fully integrated with 300/500 gal logic
- Tank visualization: Rectangles drawn with proper dimensions at (20, 0)

**Workflow Impact:**
- Console shows both septic and dosing tank requirements
- Specifications match desired format exactly
- CAD output includes visual tank representation
- All dimensions properly converted from inches to feet
- Tank labels centered on rectangles

---

### Design Decisions

**1. Dosing Tank Size Limitation (300/500 only):**
- Reason: Contractors typically only use these two sizes for residential
- Exception: Requirements > 500 gal use single compartment septic tanks instead
- Data source: `data/fdep_tanks.csv` confirmed both sizes available

**2. Tank Placement Position (20 ft right of text):**
- Reason: Keeps tanks visible but separate from specification text
- Avoids overlap with drainfield geometry (typically centered on boundary)
- Easy to relocate in CAD if needed

**3. Dimension Conversion (inches to feet):**
- Reason: CAD drawings use feet as standard unit
- All tank dimensions in fdep_tanks.csv are in inches
- Simple conversion: feet = inches / 12.0

**4. Specification Text Reverse Order:**
- Reason: Matches standard drawing convention (bottom-to-top reading)
- Easier to read when text is placed at top of drawing
- Title serves as header when reading upward

---

### Known Limitations

1. **Tank positioning is fixed:** Tanks always placed at (20, 0) relative to spec text
   - User can manually move in CAD if needed
   - Future enhancement: Calculate optimal position based on boundary

2. **Single compartment assumption:** All tanks drawn as single rectangles
   - Dual compartment tanks exist but drawn same as single
   - Metadata includes tank type but visual is simplified

3. **No tank rotation:** Tanks always horizontal (length along X-axis)
   - Could be enhanced to optimize space usage
   - Current layout works for most cases

4. **Text label placement:** Assumes tank large enough for centered text
   - Very small tanks (<3 ft) might have overlapping text
   - Not an issue for standard residential tanks (4+ ft)

---

### Future Enhancements

1. **Smart tank positioning:**
   - Analyze boundary geometry to find optimal placement
   - Avoid overlap with drainfield or boundary
   - Consider multiple placement strategies

2. **Tank connection lines:**
   - Draw inlet/outlet connections
   - Show flow direction from septic → dosing → drainfield
   - Add dimension annotations

3. **Dual compartment visualization:**
   - Draw internal baffle for dual compartment tanks
   - Show compartment sizes
   - Add compartment labels

4. **ATU tank support:**
   - Different visualization for aerobic treatment units
   - Show internal components (aerator, clarifier)
   - Add ATU-specific dimensions

---

### Conclusion

Successfully implemented all four requested features:

1. ✓ **Specification text reversed** to match drawing convention
2. ✓ **Placeholder values replaced** with actual dimensions and sizes
3. ✓ **Dosing tank added** to specifications with proper sizing logic
4. ✓ **Tank drawings added** to CAD output with accurate dimensions

All features tested and verified working correctly. Output matches user's desired format exactly.

**Issue Status:** COMPLETE
**User Verification:** Confirmed working as expected
**Next Session:** Ready for production use

## 2025-10-05 - Critical Bug Fix: Position-Dependent Fit Failure

**Time:** 14:30 UTC
**Status:** ✓ RESOLVED
**Severity:** HIGH

---

### Problem Report

User reported that `simple_test.py` exhibited inconsistent behavior when processing geometrically identical boundaries:

- **Boundary 1** (`test_boundary (script found fit).json`): ✓ Found fit successfully
- **Boundary 2** (`test_boundary (script didn't find fit).json`): ✗ Failed to find fit

Both boundaries had:
- Identical perimeter: 122.51 ft
- Identical area: 804.5 sq ft
- Identical edge lengths and interior angles
- Same shape, just translated to different coordinate positions

---

### Investigation Process

#### Step 1: Geometric Analysis
Compared both boundary files to verify they were truly identical:

**Boundary 1 Position:**
- X range: [-5.14, 13.44]
- Y range: [-0.97, 44.71]
- Centroid: (4.15, 21.87)

**Boundary 2 Position:**
- X range: [26.14, 44.72]
- Y range: [-7.93, 37.76]
- Centroid: (35.43, 14.92)

**Findings:**
- Edge lengths: All identical within 0.000001 ft
- Interior angles: All identical within 0.0001°
- Bounding box dimensions: Identical (18.58 × 45.69 ft)
- **Conclusion:** Boundaries are geometrically identical, just translated ~31 ft in X-direction

#### Step 2: Configuration Analysis
Examined drainfield configuration coordinate system:

**MPS9 Trench Patterns:**
- Pattern [1]: X range [-4.00, 6.00], Y range [0.00, 18.00], Centroid (1.00, 9.00)
- Pattern [2]: X range [-4.00, 6.00], Y range [0.00, 28.00], Centroid (1.00, 14.00)
- All patterns positioned near origin with consistent X range

#### Step 3: Code Review
Analyzed the placement algorithm flow:

1. `selector.py:_try_product()` - Extracts shoulder polygon from config
2. `geometry.py:try_rotations()` - Attempts to find a fit with rotation
3. `geometry.py:try_edge_aligned_rotations()` - Tests rotations aligned to boundary edges
4. `geometry.py:polygon_fits()` - Checks if drainfield is within boundary

#### Step 4: Root Cause Identification

**Critical Bug Found in `geometry.py`:**

The rotation functions (`try_rotations()` and `try_edge_aligned_rotations()`) were:
1. ✓ Rotating the drainfield polygon around its centroid
2. ✗ **NOT translating it to the boundary location**
3. ✓ Checking if it fits within the boundary
4. ✗ Returning the rotated but untranslated polygon

**Why this caused position-dependent behavior:**

```
Drainfield configs positioned at: X ∈ [-4, 6]

Boundary 1 at X ∈ [-5, 13]:
  - Overlaps with drainfield position
  - Rotated drainfield COULD be within boundary
  - Result: ✓ Works (by coincidence)

Boundary 2 at X ∈ [26, 44]:
  - Separated by ~30 ft from drainfield position
  - Rotated drainfield NEVER within boundary
  - Result: ✗ Fails
```

The algorithm was effectively checking: "Does the drainfield fit at ITS CURRENT POSITION?" instead of "Does the drainfield fit ANYWHERE in the boundary?"

---

### Solution Implemented

#### Modified Files

**1. `geometry.py:try_edge_aligned_rotations()` (lines 130-185)**

**Before:**
```python
for angle in sorted(rotation_angles):
    rotated = rotate(drainfield_polygon, angle, origin='centroid')

    if polygon_fits(rotated, user_boundary):
        return (True, angle, rotated)
```

**After:**
```python
# Calculate boundary centroid once
boundary_centroid = user_boundary.centroid

for angle in sorted(rotation_angles):
    # Rotate around drainfield's centroid
    rotated = rotate(drainfield_polygon, angle, origin='centroid')

    # Translate to center on boundary
    dx = boundary_centroid.x - rotated.centroid.x
    dy = boundary_centroid.y - rotated.centroid.y
    positioned = translate(rotated, xoff=dx, yoff=dy)

    if polygon_fits(positioned, user_boundary):
        return (True, angle, positioned)
```

**2. `geometry.py:try_rotations()` (lines 188-221)**

Applied same fix to the fallback rotation loop:
- Added boundary centroid calculation
- Added translation step after each rotation
- Check fit on positioned polygon instead of just rotated polygon

**3. `selector.py:_try_product()` (lines 129-148)**

Updated offset calculation logic:

**Before:**
```python
if fits:
    dx, dy = calculate_centroid_offset(fitted_polygon, user_boundary)
```

**After:**
```python
if fits:
    # fitted_polygon is already positioned, calculate offset from original
    boundary_centroid = user_boundary.centroid
    original_centroid = shoulder_polygon.centroid
    dx = boundary_centroid.x - original_centroid.x
    dy = boundary_centroid.y - original_centroid.y
```

The offset now correctly represents the translation from the original config position to the boundary centroid, which is what `placer.py` expects.

---

### Testing & Verification

Created `test_fix_simple.py` to verify the fix with both boundary files.

**Test Configuration:**
- Required sqft: 100
- Config type: TRENCH
- Product priority: MPS9 → ARC24 → EQ36LP

**Results:**

```
Boundary 1 (previously worked):
  Status: PASS ✓
  Product: MPS9
  Pattern: [2, 2]
  Credit: 120.0 sq ft
  Rotation: 0.0°

Boundary 2 (previously failed):
  Status: PASS ✓
  Product: MPS9
  Pattern: [2, 2]
  Credit: 120.0 sq ft
  Rotation: 0.0°
```

**Conclusion:** Both boundaries now find identical configurations, confirming the fix is working correctly.

---

### Technical Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Algorithm was position-dependent
- Only worked if user boundary happened to overlap with drainfield config coordinates
- Unpredictable failures based on where user drew boundary in CAD space

**After Fix:**
- Algorithm is now position-independent
- Works regardless of absolute coordinates
- Drainfield configs are properly translated to boundary location before fit testing
- Consistent behavior across all boundary positions

---

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always test with diverse input data:** The bug only manifested when boundaries were positioned far from the origin
2. **Coordinate system assumptions:** Never assume geometric objects will be at specific absolute positions
3. **Transform order matters:** Rotation must be followed by translation to properly position objects
4. **Test position-independence:** For geometric algorithms, test with identical shapes at different positions

---

### Future Recommendations

1. Add unit tests that verify position-independence by testing identical shapes at different coordinates
2. Consider normalizing all input boundaries to a standard position before processing
3. Add validation that checks for coordinate system assumptions in geometric algorithms
4. Document the expected coordinate system for all geometric operations

---

**Issue Closed:** 2025-10-05 15:00 UTC
**Verified By:** User acceptance testing with production boundary files
**Git Commit:** (pending)

---

## 2025-10-05 - Complete Integration: JSON Output & Specification Text

**Time:** Later same day
**Status:** ✓ IMPLEMENTED
**Priority:** HIGH

---

### Problem Report

After completing the full design mode integration, user discovered three critical issues:

1. **Missing JSON Output:** Drainfield geometry was calculated and displayed in console, but NOT written to output JSON file
2. **Missing Specification Text:** The generated specification text was not inserted into the CAD JSON at (0,0)
3. **Database Connection Failure:** Database table `p3ofdep4015` was not being updated due to incorrect default credentials

Console showed successful processing:
```
Step 3: Applying configuration hierarchy...
Step 4: Generating specifications...
Step 5: Updating database...
Database connection error: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: fe_sendauth: no password supplied
```

**Impact:** While the algorithm was working perfectly (finding correct configurations), the output was incomplete - no CAD file with placed drainfield, no specification text, and no database updates.

---

### Investigation Process

#### Step 1: Verify Output File Generation

Examined `main.py:run_full_design()`:
- Function was calculating everything correctly ✓
- Creating specification text ✓
- Displaying results to console ✓
- **BUT:** No code to generate output JSON file ✗

The `place_drainfield()` function existed in `placer.py` but was never being called from the main workflow.

#### Step 2: Examine Text Insertion

Checked `placer.py:place_drainfield()`:
```python
def place_drainfield(base_cad_json, selection_result):
    # ... transforms and places polylines ...
    return output_cad
```

Function only handled drainfield polylines, no text insertion capability.

#### Step 3: Database Connection Analysis

User provided correct database configuration from another app:
```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    "dbname": "redbayengineering",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "197420162018",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "5432"
}
```

Current `database.py` had generic defaults (localhost, empty password).

#### Step 4: Text Format Requirements

User provided example JSON (`text_example.json`) showing CAD app requires:
- **Separate text objects for each line** (not single multiline text with `\n`)
- Y coordinate decreases for each line
- Line spacing: 5.52 units
- Text height: 5

Example format:
```json
{
  "x": -321,
  "y": -198.5,
  "text": "============================",
  "height": 5,
  ...
},
{
  "x": -321,
  "y": -192.98,  // Decreases by 5.52
  "text": "SEPTIC SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS",
  "height": 5,
  ...
}
```

---

### Solution Implemented

#### File 1: `placer.py`

**Change 1: Add spec_text parameter and text insertion**

Modified `place_drainfield()` signature:
```python
def place_drainfield(base_cad_json, selection_result, spec_text=None):
```

Added text array initialization:
```python
# Ensure texts array exists
if 'texts' not in output_cad:
    output_cad['texts'] = []
```

**Initial attempt - Single multiline text:**
```python
if spec_text:
    text_obj = {
        'x': 0.0,
        'y': 0.0,
        'text': spec_text,  # Contains \n for line breaks
        'height': 3,
        'rotation': 0,
        'layer': 'Annotations',
        'metadata': {
            'source': 'drainfield_placer',
            'type': 'specification'
        }
    }
    output_cad['texts'].append(text_obj)
```

**Problem:** CAD app doesn't support multiline text with `\n` - needs separate objects.

**Final implementation - Separate text objects per line:**
```python
if spec_text:
    lines = spec_text.split('\n')
    line_spacing = 5.52  # Vertical spacing between lines
    text_height = 5      # Text height

    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if line.strip():  # Only add non-empty lines
            text_obj = {
                'x': 0.0,
                'y': -i * line_spacing,  # Decrease Y for each line
                'text': line,
                'height': text_height,
                'rotation': 0,
                'selected': False
            }
            output_cad['texts'].append(text_obj)
```

**Change 2: Update split drainfield function**

Modified `place_split_drainfield()` to support text:
```python
def place_split_drainfield(base_cad_json, selection_result, spec_text=None):
    output_cad = copy.deepcopy(base_cad_json)

    # Place first drainfield (without text)
    output_cad = place_drainfield(output_cad, selection_result['drainfield_1'])

    # Place second drainfield (with text if provided)
    output_cad = place_drainfield(output_cad, selection_result['drainfield_2'], spec_text)

    return output_cad
```

#### File 2: `main.py`

**Change 1: Add boundary_json parameter**

Modified `run_full_design()` signature:
```python
def run_full_design(self, bedrooms, square_footage, water_type, net_acreage,
                   boundary_polygon, boundary_json=None, property_id=None,
                   benchmark_text=None, num_homes=1, update_database=True):
```

**Change 2: Add Step 6 - Generate output JSON**

Inserted after Step 5 (database update):
```python
# Step 6: Generate output JSON with placed drainfield
if boundary_json:
    print("Step 6: Generating output JSON with placed drainfield...")
    try:
        # Place drainfield into the CAD JSON
        if is_split:
            output_json = place_split_drainfield(boundary_json, result, spec_text)
        else:
            output_json = place_drainfield(boundary_json, result, spec_text)

        # Save to output file
        output_filename = f"output_drainfield_{property_id if property_id else 'design'}.json"
        with open(output_filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(output_json, f, indent=2)

        print(f"  ✓ Output saved to: {output_filename}")
        result['output_json_file'] = output_filename
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"  ⚠ Error creating output JSON: {e}")
print()
```

**Change 3: Pass boundary_json to run_full_design()**

Updated main() function to pass original CAD JSON:
```python
# After loading boundary_data
result = app.run_full_design(
    bedrooms=bedrooms,
    square_footage=square_footage,
    water_type=water_type,
    net_acreage=net_acreage,
    boundary_polygon=boundary_polygon,
    boundary_json=boundary_data,  # ← Added this
    property_id=property_id,
    benchmark_text=benchmark_text,
    num_homes=num_homes,
    update_database=(property_id is not None)
)
```

#### File 3: `database.py`

**Change: Update default database credentials**

Modified `_get_default_config()`:
```python
def _get_default_config(self):
    """Get database config from environment variables"""
    return {
        'host': os.getenv('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),      # Was: 'localhost'
        'database': os.getenv('DB_NAME', 'redbayengineering'),  # Was: 'postgres'
        'user': os.getenv('DB_USER', 'postgres'),
        'password': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD', '197420162018'),  # Was: ''
        'port': os.getenv('DB_PORT', '5432')
    }
```

### Testing & Verification

**Test Run with property ID 777:**
```
Number of bedrooms: 3
Building square footage: 2250
Water type: p
Net acreage: 1.00
Property ID: 777

Results:
  Step 1: Calculating sewage flow... ✓ 300 GPD
  Step 2: Determining tank requirements... ✓ 900 gallons
  Step 3: Applying configuration hierarchy... ✓ ARC24 trench [5,5,5,5,5]
  Step 4: Generating specifications... ✓
  Step 5: Updating database... ✓ Database updated for property 777
  Step 6: Generating output JSON... ✓ Output saved to: output_drainfield_777.json
```

**Output File Verification:**
```bash
python3 -c "import json; data=json.load(open('output_drainfield_777.json'));
df_polylines = [p for p in data['polylines'] if p.get('metadata',{}).get('source')=='drainfield_placer'];
df_texts = [t for t in data['texts'] if t.get('text','').startswith('====')];
print(f'Drainfield polylines: {len(df_polylines)}');
print(f'Spec text objects: {len(df_texts)}')"

Output:
  Drainfield polylines: 26  ✓
  Spec text objects: 10     ✓ (One per line of specification)
```

**Database Verification:**
Table `p3ofdep4015` updated with:
- page3_09: Net acreage (1.0)
- page3_10: Flow GPD (300)
- page3_12: Authorized flow (2500)
- page3_13: GPD multiplier ("2500")
- page3_14: Unobstructed area available (1038.8)
- page3_15: Unobstructed area required (563)
- page3_121: Rate ("0.8/Sand")
- page3_123: Is trench (true)
- page3_124: Is bed (false)

### Output File Structure

The generated `output_drainfield_777.json` contains:

**1. Original boundary and all existing geometry:**
- All original layers
- All original lines, dimensions, circles
- Original texts
- Original polylines (including boundary on `polyline_boundary` layer)

**2. Placed drainfield geometry (26 polylines):**
```json
{
  "points": [...],
  "selected": false,
  "layer": null,
  "metadata": {
    "source": "drainfield_placer",
    "product": "arc24",
    "pattern": "[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]",
    "rotation": 0.0,
    "is_shoulder": false
  }
}
```

**3. Specification text (10 separate text objects):**
```json
{
  "x": 0.0,
  "y": 0.0,
  "text": "============================",
  "height": 5,
  "rotation": 0,
  "selected": false
},
{
  "x": 0.0,
  "y": -5.52,
  "text": "SEPTIC SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS",
  "height": 5,
  "rotation": 0,
  "selected": false
},
... (8 more lines)
```

### Technical Impact

**Before Changes:**
- Drainfield calculation: ✓ Working
- Console output: ✓ Working
- JSON output: ✗ Missing
- Specification text: ✗ Missing
- Database updates: ✗ Failing

**After Changes:**
- Drainfield calculation: ✓ Working
- Console output: ✓ Working
- JSON output: ✓ Complete CAD file with placed drainfield
- Specification text: ✓ Properly formatted (separate objects per line)
- Database updates: ✓ Working

**Workflow Now:**
1. User provides building specs and boundary JSON
2. App calculates sewage flow, tank sizing, drainfield requirements
3. App applies hierarchy to find optimal drainfield configuration
4. App places drainfield geometry into boundary
5. App generates specification text
6. App updates database (if property_id provided)
7. **App outputs complete CAD JSON file ready to import**

---

### Current Status

**Working:**
- ✓ Full design mode with all calculations
- ✓ Drainfield geometry placement (26 polylines for ARC24 trench [5,5,5,5,5])
- ✓ Output JSON file generation (`output_drainfield_{property_id}.json`)
- ✓ Database table updates (`p3ofdep4015`)
- ✓ Text insertion at (0,0) with separate objects per line

**Needs Tweaking:**
- Text format may need minor adjustments after testing in CAD app
- Line spacing (currently 5.52) may need adjustment
- Text height (currently 5) may need adjustment
- Text position (currently starting at 0,0) may need offset

**Next Steps:**
1. Test output JSON in CAD application
2. Verify drainfield polylines display correctly with proper layers
3. Verify specification text displays correctly
4. Adjust text formatting parameters if needed
5. Test with different drainfield configurations (bed, ATU, split systems)
